#KinekT -- Connecting Startups to Launch Spaces.

Kinekt is a mobile application with the “airbnb” concept, aimed at those businesses who have unused & underused spaces, left over from their recent downsizes, acquisitions, and/or mergers, or simply those businesses wanting exposure to innovators in their sectors. These businesses (small, mid-sized, and large) who are desiring to sublet their excess space short-term to a startup ready to scale up.
